		<dt>General</dt>
		<dd>The following are the rules or "Terms" that govern use of the <b>Rockstar Seating</b> Web site ("Site"). By using or visiting the Site, you expressly agree to be bound by these Terms and to follow these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations governing the Site. <b>Rockstar Seating</b> reserves the right to change these Terms at any time, effective immediately upon posting on the Site.

		<dt>Orders</dt>
		<dd>All sales are final.  Since tickets are a one-of-a-kind item and not replaceable, there are no refunds, exchanges or cancellations. If an event is postponed, tickets will be honored for the rescheduled date. New tickets will not need to be issued. If an event is cancelled without a rescheduled date, you will receive a full refund for the amount that you paid for the tickets. Any shipping and handling charges are not refundable. <b>Rockstar Seating</b> will not issue exchanges or refunds after a purchase has been made or for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. When you receive your tickets, please keep them in a safe place. Please note that direct sunlight or heat can sometimes damage tickets.</dd>
		<dd>Occasionally, the tickets you order may no longer be available at the time your order is received. If equivalent or better seat locations are available at the same price, and you have chosen to be automatically upgraded, we will fill your with the alternative seat locations. If you are automatically upgraded, your credit card will be charged at the time your order is received and you will be contacted for notification of your new seat locations. If you have not chosen to be automatically upgraded, a <b>Rockstar Seating</b> representative will contact you to discuss alternative seat locations, and your credit card will not be charged until we have received permission from you to fill your order with alternative seat locations.</dd>
		<dd>All orders are shipped to the billing address of your credit card (no exceptions) via your chosen shipping method. Most orders are processed the same business day in which they are received. Orders placed after hours will be processed on the next business day.  For certain events, tickets may not be available for immediate shipment. In this case, a <b>Rockstar Seating</b> representative will contact you with notification of approximately when your tickets will be shipped. All shipments require a signature at the point of delivery. </dd>
